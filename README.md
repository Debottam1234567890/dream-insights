# Dream Analyzer + Future Predictor

Welcome to **Dream Analyzer + Future Predictor** ‚Äî  
An intelligent Python-based tool that analyzes your dreams and predicts your future moods, challenges, or opportunities based on dream psychology and AI!

---

## Features

### Dream Analysis
Predicts 10 key psychological factors from your dream description:
1. **Lucidity**
2. **Emotional Intensity**
3. **Realism**
4. **Fear Level**
5. **Joy Level**
6. **Control Over Dream**
7. **Symbolism Strength**
8. **Memory Recall After Waking**
9. **Strangeness**
10. **Vividness**

### Smart Mental Interpretation
Provides detailed, human-style explanations for each predicted factor.

### PCA Visualization
Projects your dream onto a 2D space alongside previous dreams, helping you see dream patterns visually.

### Dream Factor Bar Chart
Displays a beautiful bar chart showing how strongly each factor appeared in your dream.

### Real Life Prediction
Based on your dream‚Äôs emotional profile, the analyzer predicts a possible upcoming event or advice for your waking life!

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### Data Preparation
- A CSV file (`dream_dataset.csv`) containing past dream descriptions and their annotated psychological factors is used to train the model.

### Model Training
1. Texts are vectorized using **TF-IDF**.
2. A **Random Forest Regressor** (wrapped in `MultiOutputRegressor`) is trained to predict the dream factors.

### Input Your Dream
- When you input a new dream description, the model analyzes it and predicts the values for each psychological factor.

### Interpretation and Visualization
- The system explains what each factor means.
- It projects your dream in a **PCA graph** and shows a **factor bar plot**.

### Bonus Prediction
- The analyzer generates a random but smart "fortune" about your near future based on your dream factors!

## Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**

### Libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

Install all dependencies via:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Make sure you have a `dream_dataset.csv` file with the following columns:
   - **Dream Description**
   - The 10 factor columns mentioned above.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python dream_analyzer.py
   ```
4. Follow the prompt to enter your dream description.

## Why This Matters

Dreams reflect your subconscious mind.  
This project shows how **machine learning + human psychology** can combine to analyze dreams, visualize emotions, and even inspire your real-world actions!

*"Dreams are not just random ‚Äî they are the subconscious stories we tell ourselves."*
