# Dream Analyzer: A Machine Learning-Based Tool for Dream Analysis

## Description
Dream Analyzer uses Machine Learning (ML), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze and understand dreams. It processes dream-related data, visualizes the relationships between features, and provides insights into various dream factors such as lucidity.

## Features
- **Dream Description Processing:** Uses NLP with TF-IDF to extract meaningful features from the dream descriptions.
- **Data Analysis:** Scales numeric features and applies PCA for dimensionality reduction.
- **Visualization:** Visualizes dream data using 2D PCA plots and feature distribution boxplots.
- **User Interaction:** Allows users to input new dream data, scale features, and visualize PCA projections.
- **Dream Analysis:** Predicts dream lucidity based on user-input features and dream descriptions.

## Getting Started
To run this project locally, you'll need to set up the environment and dependencies.

### Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Debottam1234567890/dream-analyzer.git
```

### Install the required Python packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Prerequisites
This project requires the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `nltk` (for NLP tasks)

Ensure you have these libraries installed using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk
```

## Installation
Clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Debottam1234567890/dream-analyzer.git
```

Install required dependencies: Make sure Python 3.x is installed. Then, create a virtual environment and install the necessary packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the script: To analyze your own dream data, execute the main Python file:
```bash
python dream_analyzer.py
```

### Input Dream Description
When prompted, input your dream description and values for the other dream features. The program will process the data and show visualizations.

### Visualizations
The tool will generate plots, including:
- **PCA Projection:** A scatter plot showing the 2D reduction of the dream data.
- **Feature Distribution:** Boxplots that represent the distribution of different dream factors.
