🔬 NEUROSCIENCE & DREAM RESEARCH
Brain Activity During Dreaming
REM Sleep Neural Patterns:

High Activity: Limbic system (emotions), visual cortex, motor cortex
Low Activity: Prefrontal cortex (logic, self-awareness), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (working memory)
Acetylcholine: Increased, promotes vivid imagery
Norepinephrine & Serotonin: Decreased, reduces logical thinking

This Explains:

Emotional intensity of dreams
Visual vividness
Illogical narratives
Lack of self-awareness (non-lucid)
Motor imagery without movement (atonia)
Acceptance of bizarre events

Memory Consolidation Theories
Synaptic Homeostasis Hypothesis:

Waking strengthens synapses (learning)
Sleep downscales overall synaptic strength
Preserves important memories, prunes trivial ones
Dreams as byproduct of this process

Active Systems Consolidation:

Hippocampus replays experiences to cortex
Temporary memories become long-term
Integration with existing knowledge
Pattern extraction and generalization

Emotional Memory Processing:

REM sleep strips emotional charge from memories
"Sleep to remember, sleep to forget" paradox
Preserves memory content, reduces reactivity
PTSD nightmares as failed processing

Contemporary Dream Research Findings

Dream content reflects waking concerns (continuity hypothesis supported)
Emotional concerns appear more than neutral events
Problem-solving can occur during REM sleep
Creativity enhanced by REM dreaming
Individual differences in dream recall related to brain structure
Dreams can be influenced by external stimuli
Dream content can be partially decoded from brain activity

Dream Recall Factors
Enhances Recall:

Waking during/just after REM period
Higher openness to experience personality
Greater interest in dreams
Keeping dream journal
Meditation and mindfulness practice
Adequate, undisturbed sleep
Certain medications (e.g., B6 vitamins)

Reduces Recall:

Alarm clocks pulling from deep sleep
Sleep deprivation
Alcohol and marijuana
Some antidepressants
Busy morning routines
Low prioritization of dreams

Feeling: What was the dominant emotion in the dream?
Conflict: What tension or problem was present?
Resolution: Did the dream offer any solution or direction?
